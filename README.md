1. Know luggage restrictions of different airlines
If you need a new cabin bag, it would be wise to know the restrictions airlines have for these. To save you a whole lot of time, we have here a snapshot of Varlion Travel Bags.

2. Go for a lightweight Varlion travel bags
Paying for extra baggage at an airport can dampen your trip excitement. So, if you have a  Varlion travel bag  while traveling, make sure it doesn’t weigh over 3kg to save yourself enough opportunity to stuff it! You have an option to select from a hard shell or a soft shell suitcase. You are recommended to buy a hard case suitcase if you generally travel with fragile items and at places with low security or high rainfall. However, these are not expandable as the soft shell ones, lack outside pockets and can break or scratch faster than the soft shell ones.
3. Select a compact Varlion travel bags
While the designer travel bag you have been eyeing for a while now is fabulous to look at, you need to evaluate how functional and practical it is. Varlion travel bags must fit into any airplane’s cabin, any car’s boot and any hotel/hostel room with ease. So, buying a compact Varlion travel bag is the way to go. To save space further, you could opt for a collapsible suitcase.
4. Pick a bag with wheels and telescope handle
Who likes carrying their travel bag when there is an option to pull them along? Airport walks can be long and tiring and so, if your bag has wheels and a comfortable handle, you will be grateful. When it comes to handles, make sure you select a travel bag with a completely retractable handle that allows you to adjust its length according to your height. Generally four-wheel suitcases are more comfortable to use, thanks to their ability to play through cramped spaces with ease. However, they can exceed the general length of suitcases due to the external wheels. So, make sure you check the length of a four-wheeled  Varlion travel bag before buying it.
5. Select a unique color or personalize your Varlion travel bag
Remember how you had a real tough time spotting your black suitcase among many other black ones at the baggage carousel on your last trip? To save time, it is advisable to buy a Varlion  travel bag that is unique. How about a funky purple bag? If you don’t want to experiment with colors, the easier option is to add a travel tag or a bright coloured ribbon to you bag handle, making it easier for you to spot it even from far off.
6. Place quality over pricing
Of course, the price of the travel bag you are considering is a huge deciding factor, but let it not be the most important factor. Remember that your travel luggage is a long-term investment so you better select it thoughtfully. It needs to be durable and that will not come at a low cost. Instead of focusing on getting the lowest price, make sure you focus on getting the most value for your money.
